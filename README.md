# **📊 Netflix Data Analysis**

## **📝 Project Overview**

The Netflix Data Analysis project aims to explore, clean, and visualize Netflix’s dataset to uncover key insights about its movies and TV shows. The analysis helps in understanding content trends, popular genres, distribution across countries, and the evolution of Netflix’s library over time.

Through this project, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## **🎯 Objectives**

Analyze Netflix’s catalog of movies and TV shows.

Identify trends in genres, ratings, and release years.

Compare the distribution of movies vs. TV shows.

Visualize country-wise and time-based content growth.

Gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing and visualization.
